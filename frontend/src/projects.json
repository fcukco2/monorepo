        "description": "The Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve Project, an initiative by InfiniteEARTH, aims to reduce Indonesia’s emissions by preserving some 64,000 hectares of tropical peat swamp forest. This area, rich in biodiversity including the endangered Bornean orangutan, was slated by the Provincial government to be converted into four palm oil estates. Located on the southern coast of Borneo in the province of Central Kalimantan, the project is also designed to protect the integrity of the adjacent world-renowned Tanjung Puting National Park, by creating a physical buffer zone on the full extent of the ~90km eastern border of the park.",

The aim of this new, larger project is to bring the benefits of direct carbon financing to surrounding communities, while simultaneously addressing alternative livelihoods and protecting vital flora and fauna. Human-wildlife conflict has been a problem in the past, as local agents are directly reliant on the environment as a means for subsistence. This Phase II project directly addresses such sources of conflict in a holistic, sustainable approach, and on a large scale. This Phase II project is classified by VCS as a mega-project, as it is estimated to reduce over 1 million tonnes of CO2-e per year.",

        "description": "The Cordillera Azul National Park REDD+ Project avoids deforestation in a magnificent expanse of lowland and montane forests in four departments in central Peru: San Martín, Ucayali, Huánuco, and Loreto. The area encompasses 1,351,964 hectares inside the national park. The park, owned by the government of Peru, is managed and financed by the Peruvian NGO Centro de Conservación, Investigación y Manejo de Áreas Naturales (CIMA) through a public-private partnership piloted by the Peruvian government. The project’s avoided-deforestation objective is accomplished by strengthening park protection, engaging local communities and other stakeholders in land-use management compatible with conservation, and improving the quality of life of the park’s neighbors.  Approximately 180,000 people in more than 200 communities – immigrant and indigenous – neighbor the park. Villagers close to the park mostly practice subsistence agriculture; those closer to major roads engage in market activities as well. CIMA and its close advisor, The Field Museum in Chicago, have worked with communities since 2002 to ensure that the project activities incorporate and reflect the values and aspirations of local residents. The project activities are highly participatory, with villagers leading several efforts and developing competencies that will enable long-term success.The biodiversity in the project area is astounding. Intact forests stretch from lowlands (150 meters) to ragged mountain peaks (2,400 meters). This eastern outlier of the Andes has been isolated sufficiently long for speciation to occur: more than 35 species new to science have been discovered in the park to date. The forests harbor rare and endangered species, as well as abundant populations of animals and plants that are crucial to the well-being of park neighbors.",

The REDD+ Project Area covers 166,983 ha of forest in the SPF Core Protection Area. The SPF was created by a Prime Ministerial Subdecree in late 2009. The site is part of the ancestral homeland of large number of ethnic Bunong people, for whom the forest is a key source of income and central to their spiritual beliefs. The area is also a meeting place for two important ecoregions – the Annamite Mountains (notable for high levels of local endemism among evergreen forest species) and the lower Mekong dry forests (which are crucial for the survival of many species typical of lowland deciduous forests). There are 41 Globally Threatened vertebrate species recorded in the Project Area (including 4 Critically Endangered and 14 Endangered). Many of these occur in globally or regionally outstanding populations, including Asian Elephants, primates, wild cattle, several carnivores and birds such as the Giant Ibis and Green Peafowl.Validation approved to the CCB Standards Third Edition, Biodiversity Gold Level, on 16 November 2015.

It is implemented by Chao’er Forest Industry Co. Ltd of China Inner Mongolia Forest Industry Group (hereafter “Project owner”) to protect the once logging forest. \r\nThe proposed project is implemented in three forest farms under the jurisdiction of the Project owner, namely Dacongshan Forest Farm, Quansheng Forest Farm, and Taerqi Forest Farm. The project has 40,027.50ha commercial forest, whose ages ranging from sapling, middle age to mature forest. Before the implementation of the project, the forest within the project area was designed and planted as commercial forest, and logged annually according to the timber production plan approved by local forestry authority . In order to protect the forest ecosystem, improve the ecological environment, increase carbon sinks, reduce GHG emission reductions and slow down climate change, the project proponent decided to implement this improved forest management project activities from December 2017 to December 2077. And from the Project Start Date, PP has stopped the commercial logging in the project area and only allowed tending and managing. \r\nThis project aims to protect 40,027.50ha commercial forest from logging. The Forest Conservation Project activities will be focused on forest resource supervision and monitoring. In order to supervise and monitor any disturbances that may affect the whole forest, a ranger team has been established to monitor the state of the forest with regard to diseases, illegal logging, hunting, fires etc. This ecosystem will then continue to provide its services to all the communities and entities that depend on it.\r\nThe project is expected to generate approximately 8,372,662 tCO2e with buffer deduction during the 30 years’ crediting period, with the annual emission reductions of 279,089 tCO2e.",
